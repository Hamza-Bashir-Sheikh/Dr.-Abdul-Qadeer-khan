              <b
                >An émigré (Muhajir) from India who migrated to Pakistan in
                1952</b
              >, Khan was educated in the metallurgical engineering departments
              of Western European technical universities where he pioneered
              studies in phase transitions of metallic alloys, uranium
              metallurgy, and isotope separation based on gas centrifuges. After
              learning of India's "Smiling Buddha" nuclear test in 1974, Khan
              joined his nation's clandestine efforts to develop atomic weapons
              when he founded the Khan Research Laboratories (KRL) in 1976 and
              was both its chief scientist and director for many years. <br />
              In January 2004, Khan was subjected to a debriefing by the
              Musharraf administration over evidence of nuclear proliferation
              handed to them by the Bush administration of the United States.
              Khan admitted his role in running a nuclear proliferation network
              – only to retract his statements in later years when he leveled
              accusations at the former administration of Pakistan's Prime
              Minister Benazir Bhutto in 1990, and also directed allegations at
              President Musharraf over the controversy in 2008. <br />
              Khan was accused of selling nuclear secrets illegally and was put
              under house arrest in 2004. After years of house arrest, Khan
              successfully filed a lawsuit against the Federal Government of
              Pakistan at the Islamabad High Court whose verdict declared his
              debriefing unconstitutional and freed him on 6 February 2009. The
              United States reacted negatively to the verdict and the Obama
              administration issued an official statement warning that Khan
              still remained a "serious proliferation risk". <br />
              After his death on 10 October 2021, he was given a state funeral
              at Faisal Mosque before being buried at the H-8 graveyard in
              Islamabad.
